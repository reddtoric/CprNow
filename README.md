# CPR Now

*** Revisiting this project because I'm not satisfied with how the app looks and mainly the code behind it. I will be using Angular(2+), Capacitor, and Ionic for learning experience.

Hands-only (chest compression-only) CPR assistant for mobile. Assisting user with audio and visual cues in 2 button presses (3 taps: App open, 'Start CPR Now' from checklist, 'Start' timer). Available for USA/Canada.

**Features:**

- From app open to start in 3 taps
- Visual and audio cues
- Completely offline
- CPR check list
- Compression depth reminder
- 100-120 CPM setting
- Last 10 start-end time
- Auto sets phone volume so audio cue is heard while giving CPR
- Auto sets phone's volume back to user's volume setting when app is closed or paused
